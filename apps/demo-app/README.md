# ng2-idle-timeout demo

This demo app wires the library into a minimal Angular shell. The schematic scaffolds `sessionTimeoutProviders`, and the app bootstraps the providers before starting the router.

## Quick start
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build --workspace=ng2-idle-timeout`
3. `npm run test --workspace=demo-app`

The smoke test asserts that project documentation stays in sync with the schematic instructions.
