## Log
- 2025-10-05 22:51 - Authored cross-tab sync plan including detailed checkpoints/sub-checkpoints; planning records reset for next session continuation.
- 2025-10-05 22:58 - Completed Checkpoint 1 discovery with design brief, syncMode behaviour matrix, risk & verification outline (`docs/planning/cross-tab-sync-discovery.md`).
- 2025-10-05 23:09 - Finished CP2a syncMode config/validation updates, updated storage serialization, and added targeted Jest coverage (`npm run test --workspace=ng2-idle-timeout -- --runTestsByPath packages/ng2-idle-timeout/src/lib/validation.spec.ts`).
- 2025-10-05 23:34 - Delivered CP2b shared-state coordinator with state bundle models, storage/broadcast wiring, and unit tests (`packages/ng2-idle-timeout/src/lib/services/shared-state-coordinator.service.spec.ts`); verified using `npm run test --workspace=ng2-idle-timeout -- --runTestsByPath packages/ng2-idle-timeout/src/lib/services/shared-state-coordinator.service.spec.ts packages/ng2-idle-timeout/src/lib/services/leader-election.service.spec.ts packages/ng2-idle-timeout/src/lib/services/server-time.service.spec.ts packages/ng2-idle-timeout/src/lib/services/session-timeout.service.spec.ts packages/ng2-idle-timeout/src/lib/services/session-timeout-cross-tab.spec.ts packages/ng2-idle-timeout/src/lib/interceptors/session-activity-http.interceptor.spec.ts`.
- 2025-10-06 00:11 - Completed CP2c messaging contract updates: shared state now travels in `sync` messages, `sync-request` responses broadcast authoritative state, and specs updated (`packages/ng2-idle-timeout/src/lib/services/session-timeout-cross-tab.spec.ts`); verified with `npm run test --workspace=ng2-idle-timeout -- --runTestsByPath packages/ng2-idle-timeout/src/lib/services/shared-state-coordinator.service.spec.ts packages/ng2-idle-timeout/src/lib/services/session-timeout-cross-tab.spec.ts packages/ng2-idle-timeout/src/lib/services/session-timeout.service.spec.ts`.
- 2025-10-06 13:42 - Completed CP3a leader integration by wiring SessionTimeoutService to coordinator events, broadcasting on leadership changes, and adding coverage in cross-tab/service specs (`packages/ng2-idle-timeout/src/lib/services/session-timeout.service.spec.ts`, `packages/ng2-idle-timeout/src/lib/services/session-timeout-cross-tab.spec.ts`); verified via `npm run test --workspace=ng2-idle-timeout -- --runTestsByPath src/lib/services/session-timeout-cross-tab.spec.ts src/lib/services/session-timeout.service.spec.ts --runInBand`.
- 2025-10-06 14:05 - CP3b leader lifecycle checkpoint started; reviewing failover scenarios and updating planning records.
- 2025-10-06 14:47 - Completed CP3b leader lifecycle failover handling: added leader epoch tracking, visibility-driven sync, and new cross-tab failover specs (verified with focused Jest runs).
- 2025-10-06 15:22 - CP3c leader test rewrite kicked off: added leader failover specs in service unit suite and reran focused Jest coverage across cross-tab and service specs.
- 2025-10-06 16:20 - Completed CP3c leader-mode regression suite additions covering heartbeat staleness, follower catch-up, and sync throttling; verified with `npm run test --workspace=ng2-idle-timeout -- --runTestsByPath src/lib/services/session-timeout-cross-tab.spec.ts src/lib/services/session-timeout.service.spec.ts --runInBand`.

- 2025-10-06 16:25 - Checkpoint 3 Leader Mode Rework marked complete following regression suite updates and verification runs.
- 2025-10-06 12:30 - Started CP4a distributed consensus design; reviewing shared-state schema and conflict scenarios.
- 2025-10-06 12:58 - Completed CP4a distributed consensus rules; documented Lamport-based ordering and implementation checklist (docs/planning/distributed-consensus-rules.md).
